Usually falling on the date of January 15 annually, this occasion marks the transition of the sun from the zodiac of Sagittarius (dhanu) to Capricorn (makara).Since the sun has made this transition which vaguely coincides with moving from south to north, the festival is dedicated to the solar deity, Surya,and is observed to mark a new beginning.Many native multi-day festivals are organised on this occasion all over India.
			    	The festivities associated with Makar Sankranti are known by various names Makara Sankranti in Kerala, Magh Bihu in Assam, Maghi Saaji in Himachal Pradesh, Maghi Sangrand in Punjab, Maghi Sangrand or Uttarain (Uttarayana) in Jammu, Sakrat in Haryana, Sakraat in Rajasthan, Sukarat in central India, Pongal in Tamil Nadu, Uttarayana in Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh, Ghughuti in Uttarakhand, Dahi Chura in Bihar, Makar Sankranti in Odisha, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Goa, West Bengal (also called Poush Sankranti or Mokor Sonkranti), Uttar Pradesh (also called Khichidi Sankranti), Uttarakhand (also called Uttarayani) or as simply, Sankranti in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, Maghe Sankranti (Nepal), Songkran (Thailand), Thingyan (Myanmar), Mohan Songkran (Cambodia), Til Sakraat in Mithila, and Shishur Senkrath (Kashmir).

			    	Every year <i>Makar Sankranti</i> is celebrated in the month of <i>January.</i> This festival is dedicated to the Hindu religious sun god Surya. This significance of Surya is traceable to the Vedic texts, particularly the Gayatri Mantra, a sacred hymn of Hinduism found in its scripture named the Rigveda.Makara Sankranti is regarded as important for spiritual practices and accordingly, people take a holy dip in rivers, especially Ganga, Yamuna, Godavari, Krishna and Kaveri. The bathing is believed to result in merit or absolution of past sins. They also pray to the Sun and give thanks for their successes and prosperity. A shared cultural practices found amongst Hindus of various parts of India is making sticky, bound sweets particularly from sesame (til) and a sugar base such as jaggery (gud, gur, gul). This type of sweet is a symbolism for being together in peace and joyfulness, despite the uniqueness and differences between individuals. For most parts of India, this period is a part of early stages of the Rabi crop and agricultural cycle, where crops have been sown and the hard work in the fields is mostly over. The time thus signifies a period of socializing and families enjoying each other's company, taking care of the cattle, and celebrating around bonfires, in Gujarat the festival is celebrated by flying kites.Makara Sankranti is an important pan-Indian solar festival, known by different names though observed on the same date, sometimes for multiple dates around the Makar Sankranti. It is known as Pedda Panduga in Andhra Pradesh, Makara Sankranti in Karnataka, Telangana, and Maharashtra, Pongal in Tamil Nadu, Magh Bihu in Assam, Magha Mela in parts of central and north India, as Makar Sankranti in the west, Makara Sankranti or Shankaranti in Kerala, and by other names.

			    	As per legends, it is considered that Sankranti - after whom the  celebration is name - was a sivinity, who executed an evil called Sankarasur.The day next to Makar Sankranti is called Karidin or Kinkrant. On this day, Devi killed the villan kinkarasur. The facts and glimpses of Makar Sakranti are available in Panchang. The Panchang is the Hindu Alamanac that gives date on the age, structure, attire, movement and development of Sankranti.<br>In India, Sakranti is viewed as a date from when the sun starts to move north, as, before Makar Sakranti, the sun radiates on the southern half of the globe. The Hindus believe this period to be the Uttarayan - or the time of propitiousnes. As per the Mahabharata, Bhishma Pitamah believed that the sun will be in Uttarayan to embrace demise.<hr>
