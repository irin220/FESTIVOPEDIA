					Eid al-Fitr marks the end of <i> Ramadan </i>, the Muslim holy month of fasting, and is celebrated during the first three days of Shawwāl, the 10th month of the Islamic calendar.<br> Eid al-Fitr has a particular salat (Islamic prayer) that consists of two rakats (units) generally performed in an open field or large hall. It may only be performed in congregation (jamāʿat) and features seven additional Takbirs (raising of the hands to the ears while saying "Allāhu ʾAkbar", meaning "God is the greatest") in the Hanafi school of Sunni Islam: three at the start of the first rakat and three just before rukūʿ in the second rakat.<br> Eid al-Fitr is a time of official receptions and private visits, when friends greet one another, presents are given, new clothes are worn, and the graves of relatives are visited.

			    	Eid ul Fitr symbolizes virtues like patience, piety, godliness and fortitude. It is a day of celebration as those who observe the fast during Ramadan receive the rewards of rigorous spiritual discipline and month-long worship. On this holy day, Muslims also show their gratitude to Allah for opening the doors of forgiveness and mercy through the sacred month of Ramadan.

                    <br>In addition to being a time for reflection, fresh beginnings and rejoicing with loved ones, Eid ul Fitr is also a reminder to be kind to those who are less fortunate. The day reminds Muslims to embrace people from social and economic circles and share the joy of festivities with the underprivileged, the poor and the neglected.<i>Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) </i>  himself used to make sure that all the needy, the downtrodden and widows were able to share the joys of Eid ul Fitr. The day is when all Muslims should count their blessings and help those who are in need of it.

			    	Eid ul-Fitr, also known as the "Festival of Breaking the Fast," is an important religious holiday celebrated by Muslims worldwide. Its history can be traced back to the 7th century in the Arabian Peninsula. The event marks the end of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting.
					<br>The origins of Eid ul-Fitr are associated with the Islamic prophet Muhammad, who received revelations of the Quran during the month of Ramadan. According to tradition, the first Eid ul-Fitr was celebrated in the year 624 CE in the city of Medina, after the Prophet Muhammad and his followers successfully completed a 29- or 30-day fast.<hr>
